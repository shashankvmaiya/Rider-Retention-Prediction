# Rider-Retention-Prediction

In this project, we aim to predict if a rider (online cab-sharing app user) will be retained by the app company or not. The data is provided by the company 'Ultimate'. We consider a user retained if they were active (i.e., took a trip) in the preceding 30 days. 

For the data provided, 37% of the users are retained. We build a predictive model using Random Forest Classifier. The most important features include
* surge percentage
* average rating by driver

The final model using Random Forest Classifier yielded a F1 score of 0.78
